*** WHAT IS THE PROCESS OF CREATING A NEW THREAD?
* Creating a new thread involves clicking on a user then clicking on the 'send' button. 
* Once the send button is clicked, we attempt to create a new thread.
* If the thread already exists (checked by server), then it rejects the new thread creation.


Todo:
Selecting a user should do a server check to see if a thread exists. If yes, the thread messages should be displayed. If not, messenger should be blank to indicate there is no shared messages.
